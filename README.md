I am a computer engineer that have a lot of interest in learning how things work. And solving puzzles, trying to figure out what can i do with a limited set of tools. That kind of thinking led me into the bachelors degree in computer science, because i think coding basically covers all this ideas.  

I have made some internships in web technologies and Gaming industry, tried to work as a team, learning the teamwork, developing better communication skills . I'm confident with my ability in communication and research.   

I focus my interest on games, and always tried to gamify my tasks. I studied game design principles, mechanics and how they work on paper. I mainly work on unity3D and developped some games, tried to upload them to appstore to understand the process. Also got some basic understanding of other game engines.
