I'm a Computer Engineer with a strong interest in understanding how systems work and solving problems with limited tools. This mindset naturally led me to explore game development, where technical problem-solving and creativity go hand in hand.

I primarily work with Unreal Engine, developing gameplay systems, building mechanics, and exploring design ideas from both a technical and theoretical perspective. I also have experience with Unity and a basic familiarity with other game engines.

Collaboration and clear communication are important to me. I value working as part of a team, sharing ideas, and approaching challenges with a problem-solving mindset. I'm especially interested in game design principles and how thoughtful systems can create engaging player experiences.
