## About Myself

I am a computer engineer that have a lot of interest in learning how things work. And solving puzzles , trying to figure out what can i do with a limited set of tools. That kind of thinking led me into the bachelors degree in computer science , because i think coding basically covers all this ideas.

I learned basics of coding in university , algorithms  , Object Oriented Programming ideals , writing a cleaner code , learning about performance and theory. Also i learned to actually implement those ideas on different coding languages , such as C# , python , ruby , C++ and languages i have tried to write some code in. I'm not sufficent at those because i always learned just about enough to get my projects done .

I have made some internships in web technologies and gaming industry , and tried to work as a team , learning the teamwork , developing better communication skills . I'm confident with my ability in communication and research.

I focus my interest on games , and always tried to gamify my tasks. As in making algoritms , i always tried to make some similarities to a game.
